Study the scenario and complete the question(s) that follow:

```
Mandela Day
Every year Pearson participates in raising funds for the Childrenâ€™s Home on Mandela Day. This
year Pearson has called on volunteer students to sell lucky draw tickets. Students will be
selling numbered tickets, each ticket having an equal chance of winning a great prize. Tickets
are prized at R40 per ticket. Just before the Mandela Day is celebrated, all the winning ticket
numbers will be drawn, using Random Number Generator(RNG) system, from a pool that
contains all the ticket numbers sold.
Every volunteer student registers their name and have to report the number of tickets they sold
at the Student Admin Block. To get the students motivated in this drive, the student who sells
the maximum number of tickets will have a 10% of the money they generated subtracted from
their total fees.
As it is a volunteer program, the number of students that will participate is not known.

2.1 You are required to design a C++ program that will:
  a. Input student name and number of tickets sold                                          (2 Marks)
  b. Avoid error of division by zero                                                        (5 Marks)
  c. Output total number of tickets sold, average tickets per each student and total amount
     of money generated                                                                     (6 Marks)
  d. Uses a sentinel-controlled loop to determine total number of volunteers                (10 Marks)

2.2 For future improvements of the Mandela Day Celebrations and to get the students
    motivated in this drive, Pearson needs information regarding the highest and lowest
    individual number of ticket sold as described in the scenario. Design a C++ program to
    determine the highest and lowest ticket sales. For this question, assume that 200 students
    volunteered.                                                                            (17 Marks)

2.3 In programming, certain tasks like the ones you performed in 2.1 and 2.2, cannot be
    accomplished simply by performing a set of ordered steps. Programmers use structures
    such as decision and repetition structures. Explain two examples of decision structures and
    three examples of repetition structures.                                                (15 Marks)
