Question:

Study the scenario and complete the question(s) that follow:

Student Billing

A typical college bills its students based on whether the student is a part-time or a full-time
student. A full time student pays more fees compared to a part-time student but completes
college earlier than a part time student. The students are billed as follows:

Part Time
Registration fees: R 800
Basic student service fees: R4000
Cost of module: R1600 per module

Full Time Student
Registration fees: R1500
Basic student service fees: R4000 for the first 5 services. R1000 for each additional service.
Cost of module: R7000 for each module for any number of modules.

The basic student service fees cover services that benefit the student and enhance student
experience. Full time students can have additional services but part time students can only
have the basic services.

The College Accounting System calculates and prints the student number and the billing
amount for each student using the following information, as provided by the user:
1. The student number, which is an integer
2. The student code which indicates if the student is part time or full time. Code P or p
indicates a part-time student and code F or f indicates a full time student
3. The number of modules the student takes.
4. For full time students, the number of basic student services.

                                                                      Source: Bonyongwa, T (2018)

Use the information provided in the scenario to answer the following questions:

1.1 Develop a C++ program that outputs a student number and billing amount. Your program
    should:

    a. Alert the user if a wrong student code is inputted             (1 Marks)
    b. Use named constants                                            (4 Marks)
    c. Be documented internally                                       (5 Marks)
    d. Use switch statements                                          (20 Marks)
